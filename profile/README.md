## 🚀 What We Do

We are revolutionizing the way autonomous agents interact with source code.  
LiquidOS enables intelligent agents to search, understand, and act on code context across large repositories in real time.

## 🧠 Our Mission

To build the **GitHub for Semantic Code** — a system that empowers developers and organizations to build more adaptive, intelligent software.

## 🧭 Our Values

- **Innovation-First** – We push the limits of what's possible in AI systems and dev tooling.
- **User-Centric** – Every design decision is guided by simplicity, speed, and real-world usability.
- **Integrity & Openness** – We build in the open and value transparency.
- **Safety by Design** – Rust is our foundation for concurrency, memory safety, and performance.
