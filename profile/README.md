## 🚀 What We Do

We are building the future stack for AI — LiquidOS delivers foundational infrastructure that lets businesses deploy efficient, capable, and private Agentic AI systems across every scale, from edge devices to the cloud.

---

## 🧠 Our Mission

To make efficient general-purpose AI at every scale — enabling users to access, control, and customize powerful AI that works well across environments (on-device, private, enterprise). We believe AI should respect performance, domain-specific needs, and user privacy while being broadly useful. We believe this is possible with native support for Agentic AI at Edge.
